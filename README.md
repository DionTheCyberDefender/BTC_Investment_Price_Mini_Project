#Bitcoin Investment Value in USD (Calculator)

This project's inspiration originated from the TryHackMe Room **"Python Basics"**, where the module illustrated how to use a web-based code editor to learn some foundational Python principles. 
    One of the hands on labs featured coding a short Bitcoin Project.

**The Goal of TryHackMe's version of the BTC Mini Project was:**
_"You've invested in Bitcoin and want to write a program that tells you when the value of Bitcoin falls below a particular value in dollars.
Write a function called bitcoinToUSD with two parameters: bitcoin_amount, the amount of Bitcoin you own, and bitcoin_value_usd, the value of bitcoin in USD. The function should return usd_value, which is your bitcoin value in USD (to calculate this, in the function, you times bitcoin_amount variable by bitcoin_value_usd variable and return the value)."_

**Object1:**
Once you've written the bitcoinToUSD function, use it to calculate the value of your Bitcoin in USD, and then create an if statement to determine if the value falls below $30,000:
If it does, output a message to alert you _(Ex: "Alert!")._

Also create an else or elif statement if the value rises above $30,000:
If it does, output a message to alert you _(Ex: "BTC is worth more than 30,000")._

**Object2:**
Additionally, We had to see that when the value of one Bitcoin varied if the code would recognize the value changes on its on.

_(Ex: If One Bitcoin is now worth $24,000, once you manually hardcode the "bitcoin_to_usd" variable value to 24000, will your Python program recognise that your investment is below the $30,000 threshold.)

_**I would like to consider myself a new age Crypto Connoisseur so this THM project gave me the idea to make a BTC Investment calculator that gives you the value of your investment in USD in real time.**_

   ** Feel Free to test this out and use it for your real world BTC investment portfolio. I will update the code as I see neccessary (to make it more efficient for other Tokens).**

FUN FACT: Many do not know this, but Cryptocurrency/Blockchain Technology is how I first encountered my passion for Cybersecurity. This was due to the events of the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack.
